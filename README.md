# p1CvApp
My Projects leading me to a FullStacker.
I am working on eight (well 21 currently) smaller or bigger Django -projects.  This App pulls eigth of them together.
It is basic Generic View based implementation, but I think as that, quite ok. db is Django standard SQLite.

This base CV presents eight Django projects all from little different perspective, as follows:

P1 
P2
P3
P4
P5
P6
P7
P8

In addition to above, menu items give some insight on my earlier things and also some commenting on why I just love
programming and especially why I feel Django is cool.

And then comes menu item SpinOffs.  There is all that is not standard.  Or planned for. Or supersuper cool (like my own Oura smartring app).
